## What **legisCrawler** Scrapes
This designed crawler automatically webscrapes the parliamentary questions (專案質詢) from The Website of Legislative Yuan, including a bunch of information with regards to the topic, keywords and the type.

- When **legisCrawler** is running, you will be asked which term (2nd - 10th) you would like to scrape (please, type digit number from 2 o 10). Then **legisCrawler** will automatically create a folder to restoring the parliamentary questions by the individual legislators.  

## Note
